# Segmentator Unet
This repository contains a collection of scripts and notebooks of the project that examines the use of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597" target="_blank">UNet</a> model to segment the lung fields from a set of front view chest X-rays.

The final model was then deployed in the live <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/murtagh97/segmentator_unet/main" target="_blank">web app</a> via <a href="https://streamlit.io/" target="_blank">Streamlit</a>.
